# Phases of a Crypto Bull Market

Mt Gox and Silk Road taken down. 
Soros--bubbles. When events should kill an asset but don't, take notice--framing in 2014: everything went wrong: silk road (main use case) read, Mt. Gox, etc. 

Total dismissal
Skepticism and risk aversion
Experience a full cycle that turns you into a true beleiver: more time to learn and understand, and experience the boom and bust provides a huge amount of confidence. Can survive an 80% fall, and ecosystem still continues to grow in every possible way: beliver. 

Heading into 2016: saw 'right' people starting getting Bitcoin. 
Think Asset: not payment rail--never going to replace Visa. 
No new asset gets adopted due to 2% in savings. 

### Reasoning 1
Pitch that resonanted with Ari: Offshore banking analogy
Every billionaire and large company, even fully law abiding, has assets spread around different jurisdications. Reasoning: some thing out of your control happens, such as go to court and judge freezes bank account, suddenly becomes insolvent and can't make payroll. 
Having asset across many jurisdictions: gives self a chance to make use of legal system and appeal and maintain lifestyle/business during that time. 

Bitcoin: offshore banking system without account minimums. Free from arbitrary confiscation, at least 30 trillion market here, bitcoin to capture meaningful portion of this market. 

During 2016: basically anyone who started learning about Bitcoin ended up buying some bitcoin: can see the ripples of adoption. 
Absent of something changing, adoption will only continue. 

### Reasoning 2
Dollar depreciation and fiat depreciation. Depreciation resistant asset. 


### Right way to think about Bitcoin
It trades like an option. 

#1 Rule: Don't blow up, even on bull-runs. If actively trading bitcoin, some firms very bullish on bitcoin blew up when bitcoin traded up 100%. Too much leverage, don't get liquidated and get taken out the game. 

Bitcoin is an asset that *routinely* falls 80%. Invested in Bitcoin knowing it's fallen 80% four times. Bitcoin has boom-bust cycles more extream than other asset classes. Reasons for boom-bust cycles:
- network-effect drivin value: more people who adopts bitcoin, the more valuable it is because becomes more liquid, easier to use

Knew bitcoin will enter bear market, lasting for around two years, and have to survive that (has a fund)

Expect that the asset will fall 80% somewhere in the imminent future. One thing to think about and another to live through it. VC mindset: invest in 10 years and ignore short-term volatility: understand what you're in and maintain conviction: how low is the bottom, when is the best timing. 

## Shifting asset focus
2016 Owned Ethereum. 
Mental model:

Most new tech competes on features. Usually, early new tech gets leap-frogged by other companies. First to patent something, doesn't guarantee anything. This doesn't apply to bitcoin. 

Bitcoin more similar to legacy banking. Ex: JP Morgan. JP Morgan gets found for crimes and gets slap on the wrist every year. We know JP Morgan will be around for years. JP Morgan is not competing on features or tech, they're competing on their history (longevity). Bitcoin's moat is 
- Creation myth: Satoshi (unknown) --hard to replicate
- Confidence code is code free: Audit not enough. But Bitcoin has relatively unchanged code for 10 years now, code pretty ossified, security moat. New protocal can't tackle. Tremendous confidence that bitcoin code keeps not having bugs. 
- Social concensus of 21 million. Hard-forks failed. 

## Bitcoin forks
Forks that didn't understand core-value-proposition will fail. 
Pitch: 
- Makes no sence optimizing Bitcoin as payment rail
- Bitcoin is obselete tech that wasn't optimized from the start, but that's the selling point: It's stability at protocal, code, and governance level is its selling point. 

## Interopability across chains
2017: First ever atomic-swaps across mainnets: atomic-swap is crypto-graph signature on 2 chains or more, without 3rd parties, taht allow transfer of value across blockchains.

ETH and BTC are layer 1: actual blockchain that supports communication and transactions. 
Layer 0: not payment rail, but hold coordinate communication across blockchains and act as ultimate settlement layer. 

Wrapped bitcoin--trade bitcoin on Ethereum: around 5 billion worth of Bitcoin on ethereum.
