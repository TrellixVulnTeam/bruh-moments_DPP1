# Defi Future Potential
The purpose of this document is to analyze the bull-thesis for defi, find its strongest contenders, and review the risks associated with each project. Mostly just to help me understand defi. 

## Short History of DeFi

#### Bitcoin insufficiency
Bitcoin can be used to send value from person to person, however, it is lacking many of the other services used in finance, such as lending, borrowing, trading, funding, or derivatives. Bitcoin 'script' languages is not suitable for DeFi. 

#### Rise of Ethereum
Using Solidity programming language, can be used to build smart-contracts. First substantial projects included Maker Dai and Etherdelta. 

#### Rise of ICOs
Through Ethereum, many alt-coin ICOs were overhyped. A few notable and substansive protocals are:
- Aave: lending and borrowing
- Synthetix: liquidity protocal for derivatives
- Ren: provides access to inter-blockchain liquidity
- Kyber network and Bancor: on-chain liquidity protocol
- 0x: open protocal allowing peer-to-peer exchange of assets

#### Calm period
- Uniswap: liquidity pools, automated market makers, users to contract model
- Synthetix launched liquidity incentive protocal

#### Black Thursday
- ETH dropped 30% in a day during beginning of pandemic

and then it gets real complex...

I feel it may be more worthwhile to learn what the top coins even do.
