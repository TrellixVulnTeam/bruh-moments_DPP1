# Leetcode grind lol

## Purpose
Really probably just to document leetcode problems I think are worthy of being saved and reviewed, probably with explanations in multiple languages. 

## Plan
Haven't actually started any leetcode yet, but I will probably have a jupyter for each type of question. Tbh, not sure what to expect, but ready for whatever happens. 

## Naming convention
- First letter is type (easy medium hard)
- Second is problem #
- Then is name

ie, e1-two-sum is `easy` and is problem 1.
