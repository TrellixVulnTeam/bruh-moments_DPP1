# bruh-moments--a collection of my side projects

Why is it called bruh-moments? Usually my side projects end in a 'bruh-moment'

#### What is in this repo?
Just a bunch of my projects, unorganized, and usually not working. As of 15/04/2021, I only have the crypto tab with some of my notes on it. I may decide to add in my past side-projects, like the ML stock predictor, the 'pirater', etc. 

#### Why is this repo public?
Good question. Really, it's just for me to practice git and to be more productive. It's helps me work pretending that other people can be watching what I do. But I'd appreciate it if you treat this repo as private lol. 

Also, it's so I can start building my commit history. 

#### What is the purpose of this repo?
Basically, so I don't need to create a new conda env every single time I want to try something new. This way, I can batch all my small projects together, and if one grows to a large enough side, I'll migrate it to it's own repo.
